# puzzles-and-riddles
A repository for solving code puzzles, challenges and riddles. Created by Lauri Johannes Miettinen in 2020.

## Current goals

- Find a solution to the Three Alien Overlords riddle. The riddle is immensely difficult. Gods help me.
- Currently I can develop solutions to riddles by running each of the html-files on the Chrome-browser. I am hoping to improve the software design by splitting code to different files. Chrome forbids loading JavaScript from different files if the page is running on the local computer. I must find a solution to this. Perhaps by converting the application so it can be ran locally on a Node.js-instance.
