<h1>Sea Monster Riddle</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<a>Source of this riddle is on</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YytHuow4VnU">this youtube video</a><a>. I created this program to solve the riddle without looking at the solution.</a>
<br>
<h2>The Riddle</h2>
<p>According to legend, once every thousand years a host of sea monsters emerges from the depths to demand tribute from the floating city of Atlantartica. As the ruler of the city, you’d always dismissed the stories… until today, when they rose out of the roiling waters, surrounded your city and demanded a ransom of pearls. Can you figure out which chest of pearls is the ransom?</p>
<br>
<img src="treasure-chests.png"></img>
<br>
<ol>
	<li>You need to choose 1 of the 5 chests. The ancient numerals display an accurate count of each chest's pearls.</li>
	<li>The pearls in your chest must divide into 7 equal piles. Each of those 7 piles must divide into 11 equal piles. Each of those 11 piles must divide into 13 equal piles.</li>
	<li>Each of those divisions must leave no remainders.</li>
	<li>The ancient numerical system was base 10</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>I have nominated the symbols with imaginative names</p>
<li>Chest 1: trident, n, trident, n, trident, n</li>
<li>Chest 2: bowAndArrow, stitches, stickMan, bowAndArrow, stitches, stickMan</li>
<li>Chest 3: trident, bowAndArrow, epsilon, epsilon, bowAndArrow, trident</li>
<li>Chest 4: stickMan, stickMan, Z, Z, epsilon, epsilon</li>
<li>Chest 5: house, trident, bowAndArrow, trident, bowAndArrow, house</li>
<h2>Deductions</h2>
<p>Here are deductions that helped me reach the solution</p>
<li>I wish to prove that only one chest will always have the correct number of pearls in it, no matter what its symbols mean. I can do this by writing a program that iterates through every possible combination of symbol meanings, then check if each of those numbers is divisible by the numbers 7, 11 and 13</li>
<li>Two symbols cannot be the same number. For example, chest 1 cannot have the number 111 111, because the ancients wouldn't have used two different symbols to nominate the same number.</li>
<li>The symbols n, epsilon, Z and stitches can mean any number from 0 to 9, but the symbols trident, bowAndArrow, stickMan and house can only be a number from 1 to 9. Some treasure chests start with a particular symbol, so it wouldn't make sense that the ancients would have used a symbol that stands for the number zero as the first digit of a six-figure number. (Example: Chest 3 showing a count of 012 210 or 'zero hundred twelve thousand two hundred ten, wouldn't make sense.) </li>
