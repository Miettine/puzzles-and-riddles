<h1>Three Alien Overlords</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a>Source of this riddle is on youtube video <i>Can you solve the three gods riddle? - Alex Gendler</i> (link omitted to avoid spoilers and temptation to look up the solution)</a><a>. I am writing this program to help me solve the riddle without looking at the solution.</a></p>
<image src="overlords-img-1.jpg">
<p>Created by logician Raymond Smullyan, and popularized by his colleague George Boolos, this riddle has been called the hardest logic puzzle ever.</p>
<image src="overlords-img-2.jpg">
<p>You and your team have crash-landed on an ancient planet. The only way off is to appease its three alien overlords: Tee, Eff and Arr by giving them the correct artifacts.</p>
<image src="overlords-img-3.jpg">
<image src="overlords-img-4.jpg">
<p>Unfortunately, you don't know who is who.</p>

<p>From an inscription you learn that you may ask three yes or no questions, each addressed to any one lord.</p>

<p>Tee's answers are always true, Eff's are always false and Arr's answer is random each time.</p>
<image src="overlords-img-5.jpg">
<p>But there is one problem. You've deciphered the language enough to ask any question but you don't know which of the two words 'ozo' and 'ulu' means yes and which means no.</p>

<p>How can you still figure out which alien is which?</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<ol>
<li>You may ask three 'yes or no' questions.</li>
<li>The aliens will answer either "ulu" or "ozo" to each question. One means "yes" and the other "no", but you don't know which is which.</li>
<li>Tee always tells the truth, Eff always lies, and Arr answers randomly.</li>
<li>Each question must be addressed to only one alien.</li>
<li>You can address multiple questions to the same alien.</li>
<li>You do not have to come up with all three questions at once.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't expect this to be easy and I don't expect to reach a solution with this program alone. The goal is to learn as much as possible of the puzzle with this program.</p>

<h2>Deductions</h2>
<p>Here are deductions that I have made this far (roughly in the order that I have made them).</p>
<li>The odds of guessing the overlords correctly is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6 or about 16.7%. There are six different ways to present the idols to the overlords.</li>
<li>The correct solution will have a 100% success rate, regardless of the order that the overlords appear and what the meaning for the words ozo and ulu are.</li>

<li>If I asked the same overlord three questions, it would help me figure who that overlord is. Then I would have a 50% chance of guessing the other two. I doubt that asking the same overlord three questions is the right way to go.</li>
<li>The possible combinations of directing questions to overlords is as follows. The number refers to which overlord you're addressing the question to (1,1,2 means 'Ask the first overlord a question, then the first one again, then the second one'):</li>
<ol>
	1, 1, 2<br>
	1, 2, 2<br>
	1, 2, 1<br>
	1, 2, 3<br>
</ol>
<li>'Ask the first one in line a question, then ask the second, then ask the second one again' is fundamentally the same as 'Ask the first one in line a question, then ask the third, then ask the third one again'. This is because I don't know which overlord is which.</li>
<li>I cannot deduce anything after asking the first question, since I don't know if the answer is a yes or a no. The only correct choice is to ask the second Overlord in line a question. It also makes no sense to ask the same question from the second overlord since the first answer gave me no information. The second question must be different from the first.</li>
<li>Maybe I do not need to worry about which word stands for yes and no. Perhaps the solution can only be found by comparing whether the answers are the same or if they are different.</li>
<li>Some ideas for questions:</li>
	- Are those last two answers different?<br>
	- Are there more yes-answers than no-answers?<br>
	- Are there more ulu-answers than ozo-answers?<br>
	- Does the word ulu stand for 'true'?
	- Were the last two answers a yes?
	- Were the last two answers the same?
	- Were the last two answers a no?
	- Is that the overlord who answers randomly?
	- Is one of those two overlords the one who answers randomly?
	- Using the operators AND or OR in a question: "Is the sky blue or does the word 'ozo' stand for 'yes'?"
	<br>
<li>I must be careful not ask stupid questions. Example:
- If answers to the first questions are 'ozo' and 'ozo' and if I asked the third question 'Are the answers to the first two questions the same'` - I would be asking an obvious thing that I already know. This would be the equivalent of asking whether the sky is blue. Since there are only three questions to ask, I must make the most of every question that I get and get as much information as possible with each question.</li>
<li>Here are how many combinations of answers to the three questions I can get:
<ol>
	<li>ozo, ozo, ozo</li>
	<li>ozo, ozo, ulu</li>
	<li>ozo, ulu, ozo</li>
	<li>ozo, ulu, ulu</li>
	<li>ulu, ozo, ozo</li>
	<li>ulu, ozo, ulu</li>
	<li>ulu, ulu, ozo</li>
	<li>ulu, ulu, ulu</li>
</ol>
So this adds up to 8 (like a binary number of three bits). If I do not know which word stands for 'yes' and 'no', I only have half as much because receiving the answers "ozo, ozo, ulu" is the equivalent of receiving the answers "ulu, ulu, ozo".
<li>Here are all configurations that the overlords can appear in:</li>

<ol>
	<li>Tee, Eff, Arr</li>
	<li>Tee, Arr, Eff</li>
	<li>Eff, Tee, Arr</li>
	<li>Eff, Arr, Tee</li>
	<li>Arr, Tee, Eff</li>
	<li>Arr, Eff, Tee</li>
</ol>
<li>Since there are 8 combinations of receiving answers to the three questions and only six combinations for the order that the overlords could appear in, <b>this riddle is probably not impossible to solve.</b> It might be possible to find questions that can receive answers that can be mapped to a specific order of the overlords.</li>
<li>If I do not know which word stands for 'yes' and 'no', I have only four combinations of answers. Therefore, it is imperative that I must find the meanings of the word "ulu" and "ozo" with my questions.</li>
<li>My code addresses the third question to <b>each</b> overlord. This is not cheating if my code only uses one of the three answers to deduce which overlord to give which idol. This is a feature used in-development to speed up information gathering.</li>
<li>I need to create a program that can analyze the logs of my solution programs. I must create a program that can analyze which answers map to which configuration of overlords, for example: "ozo, ozo, ulu" => Tee, Eff, Arr. If my program finds that one string of answers map to more than one configuration of overlords, then my questions are faulty and I need to improve them.</li>
<li>It turns out that console.log in a web browser is quite slow. Do not call it too many times successively.</li>
<li>I attempted to make an excel sheet designing questions and laying out the answers. It did not go very well. It seems that my questions need rethinking.</li>
<li>"Is that the overlord who answers randomly?" - is a complex question. There are 3 different ways to ask it: I can ask whether the overlord I am asking it from is the randomly answering overlord or if either of the other two overlords is the randomly answering one. I am not certain if this works as the question's strenght or </li>
<li>Asking for any overlord's identity could be an effective question if I could reliably direct it to Tee, the truthful overlord. Perhaps if I could use the first two questions to rule out which of the overlords is Tee, then ask the third question from them.</li>
<li>If I could determine which of the overlords is Eff, then I can also use the question "Is that the overlord who answers randomly?". Eff's answer is the opposite of Tee's answer but it still gives me the same information.</li>
<li>Asking for the random overlord's identity is only effective if I know which answer means "yes" and which means "no".</li>
<li>Could I use the first question to determine the meaning for the words ozo and ulu, then use the second question to determine which overlord is not Arr (not Arr = is Tee or Eff). This plan is probably easier said than done because I could unwillingly direct one of the first two questions to Arr whose answers will only throw me off.</li>
<li>I bet I can only determine the likelyhoods of the overlords to a certain probability, then I can ask the third question from Tee or Eff and reliably deduce the order of the overlords from the answers.</li>
<li>With the first two questions I could determine which of the overlords are Arr. I could probably use the third question to determine the following facts:</li>
<ol>
	<li>Which of the two remaining overlords is Tee and which is Eff</li>
	<li>What are the meanings of the words ozo and ulu (deduce from all three answers)</li>
</ol>
<li>With the first two questions I could determine which of the overlords are Arr. I could probably use the third question to determine the following facts:</li>
